# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a team it is better to have an online repository to keep everything
centralized and accessible. Sometimes you might need to use different work stations and
a remote repository is more practical.


# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Your local repository might not be ready for release to the public. It's better to do this manually
and control all releases to the public. You can keep the releases logical too.


# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - it is a clone that is located on Github's servers. It keeps track of who you forked it from.
Clone - A copy of another repository.
Branch - A separate production of a code at a certain point in time.
