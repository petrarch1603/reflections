# How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed only the differences between the file.
This saves time and allows me to work on other things.


# How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Old versions may have previously used methods or data that were lost in an update.
With version control those old files can easily be found and researched for solving problems in the current version.


# What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: You can submit the commit at a logical point with a message about what was changed.
	This is easier to search thru and review later on. 

Con: It's easy to forget to commit and do too little or too much work between commits. 
	Requires user activation.


# Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git repositories are often inter-connected. Changes to files will happen simultaneously during commits.
Therefore it is practical to commit multiple files together in a batch.

Google docs treats each file indpendently and therefore keeps the version control simple.


# How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows the history of commits with the user submitted description of what was changed.
Git diff shows the actual changed lines between two commits.


# How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control keeps all changes documented, so if you break something there is a procedure for finding the bug.
It's still tedious to go thru the different commits and finding the bug, but at least you have a systematic way to find the bug.

# Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use git for version control on my projects.
I also want to showcase my work to the world.
