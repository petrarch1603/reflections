# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates a structured repository with git metadata.
You need to do it to start the project and keep it organized. 


# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the gateway to the repository. It allows you to have control over the commit process.
In a project with a lot of files and moving parts it allows you to explicitly choose which files to add
and to include a clear commit message.
